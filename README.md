# Object Detection and Text-to-Speech using MobileNet and JavaScript

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time object detection system using the MobileNet model through TensorFlow.js. Additionally, it incorporates a text-to-speech feature to announce the detected objects. The web-based application runs entirely in the browser, making it accessible to users without the need for server-side processing.

## Features
Object Detection: Utilizes MobileNet, a lightweight deep learning model, for efficient real-time object detection directly in the browser.

Text-to-Speech: Converts the detected objects into spoken words, enhancing accessibility and user experience.

Web-Based: No server-side processing required. The entire application runs in the user's browser, making it lightweight and easily deployable.

## Technologies Used
TensorFlow.js: Enables machine learning in the browser, allowing the use of pre-trained models like MobileNet.

MobileNet: A pre-trained deep learning model optimized for mobile and edge devices.

Web Speech API: Used for the text-to-speech functionality.

## How to Use
Clone the repository:

Open the index.html file in a modern web browser.

Allow camera access when prompted.

Point the camera at objects, and the application will perform real-time object detection and announce the identified objects.
